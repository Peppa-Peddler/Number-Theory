## Peano axioms

> In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting and ordering.

The Natural numbers are formal defined by the **Peano axioms**:

1. 0 is a natural number.
2. Every Natural number `n` has a succesor, and is denoted as `s(n)`.
3. 0 is not the succesor of any natural number: `s(n) != 0`.
4. If `s(x) = s(y)`, then `x = y`.
5. If 0 belongs to a `set S`, and `n belongs to S` implies `s(n) belongs to S`;
   then `Every natural number belongs to S`.

The fifth axiom is called the **axiom of induction**. If `s(n) = n + 1`, this
axiom also works if `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n-1 belongs to S` implies `n belongs to S`.

## Divisibility
>A divisibility rule is a shorthand way of determining whether a given number is divisible by a fixed divisor without performing the division, usually by examining its digits.

We say `d` *divides* `n` and we write `d | n` if `n = cd` for some `c`, where `d, n, c, d` are integers. We also say that `n` is a *multiple* of `d`, `d` is a *divider* of `n`, or `d` is a factor of `n`.

### Properties:

`a, b, c, d, e, ..., n` are integers.

1. `n | n` (reflection)
2. `d | n` and `n | m` implies `d | m` (Transitivity)
3. `d | n` and `d | m` implies `d | ( an + bm )` (Linearity)
4. `d | n` implies `ad | an` (Multiplication)
5. `ad | an` and `a != 0` implies `d | n` (Simplication)
6. `1 | n`
7. `n | 0`
8. `0 | n` implies `n = 0`
9. `d | n` and `n != 0` implies `|d| <= |n|`
9. `d | n` and `n | d` implies `|d| = |n|`
10. `d | n` and `d != 0` implies `(n/d) | n`

## Greatest Common Divisor

If an integer `d` divides two integers `a` and `b`, then `d` is called *Common Divisor* of `a` and `b`.

**Teorem:** Let `a` and `b` be integers, exists a common divisor `d` of `a` and `b`, such that: `d = ax + by`, where `x` and `y` are integers and every divisor of `a` and `b` divides `d`.

`d` is called the *Greatest Common Divisor* of `a` and `b` and is denoted as `gcd(a, b)` or just `(a, b)`. The *diofantic equation* `d = ax + by` is called **BÃ©zout's identity**. If `(a, b) = 1` then `a` and `b` are *coprime*.

### Properties:

1. `(a, b) = (b ,a)` (Commutativity)
2. `(a, (b, c)) = ((a, b), c)` (Asociativity)
2. `(ac, bc) = |c|(a, b)` (Distributivity)
2. `(a, 1) = (1, a) = 1`, `(a, 0) = (0, a) = |a|`

**Euclides Lema:** if `a | bc` and `(a, b) = 1`, then `a | c`.

## Prime Numbers

An integer `n` is called **prime** if `n > 1` and its only divisors are 1 and
itself. If `n > 1` and is not prime, then is called 'composite'.

1. Every number `n > 1` is either prime or is composed by the *product* of prime numbers.
2. There exists and infinity of prime numbers.
3. If a prime `p` doesn't divide `a`, then `(p,a) = 1`
4. If `p` is prime and `p | ab`, then `p | a` or `p | b`. In general if `p |
   a1 ... an`, then there is at lease one i such that `p | ai`.
