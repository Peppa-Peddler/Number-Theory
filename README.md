##Natural Numbers and Peano axioms

> In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting and ordering.

The Natural numbers are formal defined by the **Peano axioms**:

1. **0** is a natural number.
2. Every Natural number `n` has a succesor, and is denoted as `s(n)`.
3. **0** is not the succesor of any natural number: `s(n) != 0`.
4. If `s(x) = s(y)`, then `x = y`.
5. If **0** belongs to a `set S`, and `n belongs to S` implies `s(n) belongs to S`;
   then `Every natural number belongs to S`

The fifth axiom is called the **axiom of induction**. If `s(n) = n + 1`, this
axiom also works if `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n-1 belongs to S` implies `n belongs to S`.

## Divisibility
>A divisibility rule is a shorthand way of determining whether a given number is divisible by a fixed divisor without performing the division, usually by examining its digits.

We say `d` *divides* `n` and we write `d | n` if `n = cd` for some `c`, where `d, n, c, d` are integers. We also say that `n` is a *multiple* of `d`, `d` is a *divider* of `n`, or `d` is a factor of `n`.
